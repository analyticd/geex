geex is my tweaked verion of freex.

Original readme from emacs-freex:

emacs-geex
===========

Emacs Geex mode is a minor mode for organizing and editing a
massively-hyperlinked database of your notes and ideas. It is the successor to
emacs-freex by Per B. Sederberg and Greg Detre. It's a personal wiki on
that features transclusion and backing data into SQLite.

For a more detailed description, read the
[Introduction](https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-freex/wiki/Introduction).

Make sure to read the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-freex/wiki/Installation)
though.

If you learn best by seeing, watch the
[intro screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGqaSzD-FTE).

If you learn best by doing, then you might want to skip to the
[Quickstart](https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-geex/wiki/Quickstart)
or [Tutorial](https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-geex/wiki/Tutorial),
and try working through things yourself.
